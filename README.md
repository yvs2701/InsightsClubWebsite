m# Insights Club Website
> Website is down as it was exceeding the budget of Insights Club and we decided to shut it down for now.<br>The devs and the club are working on a new website which will be up soon.
>The new website will probably be a frontend only, as developing an entire full stack solution like this one is not feasible for the club.
>
>Thank you for your support and patience. \
> Stay tuned for more updates.
